# DEPRECATED
Since 2017 there are now official organisations for [`arm32v7`](https://hub.docker.com/u/arm32v7/) and [`arm32v6`](https://hub.docker.com/u/arm32v6/). Please refer to those for newer builds.

**The Alpine Linux ARM build can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/arm32v6/alpine/)**

*Original Readme:*

---

This is a Docker base image of alpine Linux (edge). It was automatically built and deployed. 
The whole build process is crafted to require as less trust as possible and to be as open as achievable. The creation and deploy scripts as well as the resulting rootfs are browsable on Github and can be inspected and checked before using the image as a base for a Docker container. For all sources and more info check Github: https://github.com/m3adow/armhf_docker_base_images/

For now, images are rebuilt every Wednesday at 01:15 CET.
