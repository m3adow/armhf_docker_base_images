This is a Docker base image of alpine Linux edge. It was automatically built and deployed. 
The whole build process is crafted to require as less trust as possible and to be as open as achievable. The creation and deploy scripts as well as the resulting rootfs are browsable on Github and can be inspected and checked before using the image as a base for a Docker container.
