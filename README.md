### Docker Base Images for the armhf Platform
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/m3adow/docker-dokuwiki-httpd.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/m3adow/docker-dokuwiki-httpd)

As Docker doesn't officially support armhf, there are little armhf base images to be found.

These are the sources for the automated build process of armhf base images. The results can be found here: https://hub.docker.com/r/container4armhf/
To provide an environment as trustless and open as possible, the rootfs of the images as well as all creation scripts can be found here.
